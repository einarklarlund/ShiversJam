Supply Officer - teaches LIMITED SUPPLIES
//DEFAULT DIALOG
 
[The Supply Officer is hunched over her clipboard, looking back and forth to the shelves.]
Twelve cans of meal... Three jugs of fresh water...
...
Oh! You’re awake!
Are you - You’re okay, aren’t you? You hit your head on the - w-when the, uh... 
[The Supply Officer goes quiet, her eye wide.]
... Um! A-anyway! I’m taking stock of our supplies. We may uh - well, we haven’t shored →
for months now, and I don’t know if... If we’ll be able to do that again any time soon.
//LEARNED: LIMITED SUPPLIES
...

//DEATH ABOVE
I don’t really want to... think too hard about what happened, if that’s okay.
I mean - Not what happened, but, uh, what it could be like up there.
I don’t wanna b... break down.
[Her eye waters.]
Ah! S-sorry!

//UNEXPECTED
We just... really had no idea it was coming.
I don’t want to lay blame, you know? I think we’re all just a little rattled.
Like... What could we have done if we knew ahead of time, anyway?
...
[She mutters.] Maybe get some more supplies...

//NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE
With the engine the way it is, we can at least stay afloat for... Well, forever.
I’m trying to be hopeful, you know? The Handler is really good at their job.
S-so if we can keep moving, I’m sure we’ll find somewhere to shore and restock soon.
...
[She looks like she only half believes that.]

//SLOW ASCENT
... Do you not, uh, remember?
The descent was so sudden that everything rattled. The Speaker says we angered the sea.
Maybe that’s why you hit your head.
I sure hope you’re alright...

//NUCLEAR DEVASTATION
...
I hope the world is alright.

//CLOSING DIALOG
Um.. Just get some rest, okay?

//ENDING DIALOG (IF LAST ONE SPOKEN TO)
//SCREEN SHAKES. WATER SFX PLAYS
D-did you hear that?
We must have breached!
I’ll follow you to the periscope.

Auxiliary Engineer - teaches DEATH ABOVE
//DEFAULT DIALOG
[The Auxiliary Engineer faces you with a scowl.]
What?
Don’t look at me like that. This ain’t getting fixed anytime soon.
What’s the point anyway? What’s even left up there?
Is there even a world for us to return to?
...
If we’re all that’s left...
//LEARNED: DEATH ABOVE

//LIMITED SUPPLIES
If we starve, does it matter?
That Supplies Officer is smart to stay away from me right now.
I don’t have room in my heart for hopefulness.
The world is dead and we’re going to starve.
...

//UNEXPECTED
You know what?
If that damned Seer hadn’t been so worthless, then maybe -
Just maybe -
We could’ve done something to prevent the damage.
And our homeland wouldn’t have turned into a wasteland.
And we wouldn’t be stuck in a tin can full of holes.
And I wouldn’t be the one fixing them.

//NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE
Handler will get on my ass if I don’t fix this, but I couldn’t care less.
They act like nothing happened. That it’s just another day at work.
... I’d quit if it made a difference.

//SLOW ASCENT
We dove so fast that something got agitated and stabbed the hull.
Could’ve been worse. I’m sure it is worse, if I looked at the outside.
But frankly, I couldn’t give enough of a damn to check.
... Some cruel twist of fate that we made it and nothing - Nothing else did.

//NUCLEAR DEVASTATION
...
[The Engineer looks choked up.]
My baby girls...
Do you... Do you think the homeland’s safe?

//CLOSING DIALOG
You’ll find out if we flood sooner or later.
...
I’ll get around to it.

//ENDING DIALOG (IF LAST ONE SPOKEN TO)
//SCREEN SHAKES. WATER SFX PLAYS
... I think we - we surfaced.
Go look, will you?
I... I need to know how bad it is.

Seer - teaches UNEXPECTED
//DEFAULT DIALOG
...
[You find the Seer hidden away in a dark corner.]
I...need not to be spoken to.
Perhaps it is best that you leave me be.
...
I just... I don’t understand.
I should’ve - I should’ve seen it coming!
...
But I didn’t.
Just darkness.

//LIMITED SUPPLIES
It’s my fault. If I knew, we could’ve stocked up when we last shored.
Maybe then we’d... We would have a fighting chance.
[It holds itself under its cloak.]
I’ve doomed us, haven’t I...?

//DEATH ABOVE
I can’t even... I can’t even see the present.
I have no idea what it’s like up there!
It’s terrifying.
Why can’t I see anything?

//NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE
The engine will last longer than any of us.
So why is it... How can the same technology be used to...
...
I never thought I’d - We would last longer than the world.

//SLOW ASCENT
I feel awful. If I knew this was coming, we could’ve dove down sooner and avoided the damage.
There must be so much of it...
I wouldn’t blame the Speaker for hating me.
... Or anyone.

//NUCLEAR DEVASTATION
I wish everything wasn’t so... cloudy.
I want to tell everyone it’s okay, and our homeland is alive.
I want to... I want to be useful.
But there’s nothing.
...
If what Weapons says is true...
Maybe that’s why I can only see our futures.

//CLOSING DIALOG
Please don’t let the others know where I am.
I... I need some time.

//ENDING DIALOG (IF LAST ONE SPOKEN TO)
//SCREEN SHAKES. WATER SFX PLAYS
Ah!
The -  we’ve surfaced.
I... Still can’t see anything.
Will you - Will you go look? The periscope?

Engine Handler - teaches NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE
//DEFAULT DIALOG
Ey. Ya head feeling better? Knocked your noggin good.
You wondering how the engine’s faring? Fine as ever.
This thing’ll last us from this life till the next, heh.
It’s powered by molecules ‘n the tiniest explosions you can imagine.
Long as we got junk to feed it, we keep afloat. It’s a miracle, I think.
//LEARNED: NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE

//LIMITED SUPPLIES
If we run low of stuff, we run low. S’happens.
We’ll have t’ ration our food, but I’m sure somethin’ll come along.
I ain’t one to worry too much. If anything, we can always catch ourselves some fish.
Or eat each other! Gnahahaha!
... ‘Twas a joke, kid. Don’t look so scared.

//DEATH ABOVE
Auxiliary ain’t fixing the hull? Why th’ hell not?!
[Their mouth drops as you explain.]
... Oh.
I get it. He needs some time, I bet.
He has a family, y’know. Probably worried about ‘em.
Not a lot of us on this hunk o’ metal with others to worry about. Well, not me anyway.
Just the engine and me crew.

//UNEXPECTED
Th’ PSA crackled over the speakers while I was gettin’ sleep.
You know how hard it is for me t’ find the time to sleep?!
Anyway - I had to rush to make sure the engine stayed stable.
Th’ damn ocean can be so temperamental.

//SLOW ASCENT
If th’ Speaker says we go slow, we go slow. I’m good at m’ job, but I can’t work miracles.
If the creatures of the deep decided we were gonna sink, then the ocean itself would have its own lil’ apocalypse from this here thing.

//NUCLEAR DEVASTATION
Aye, Weapons has the gist of it. Our engine’s tech can be devastatin’ if used in the wrong way.
But if th’ homeland thought it best, it was probably best.
I ain’t paid enough to know the right ways to war.
We been spyin’ on the capitals for god knows how long.
... Just gotta hope they didn’ fire back.

//CLOSING DIALOG
I’ll keep us afloat, don’t you worry, pal.
You just rest your busted head.
Or go talk to the others. I ain’t yer boss.

//ENDING DIALOG (IF LAST ONE SPOKEN TO)
//SCREEN SHAKES. WATER SFX PLAYS
Oy, there we go.
Must’ve resurfaced.
Ye probably want to go peek, yeah?
Go check the periscope, then.

Speaker - teaches SLOW ASCENT
//DEFAULT DIALOG
Oh. Hello. You’re alive.
The seas were so angry when we dove, I thought we lost you.
They would be just to expect a sacrifice, after all. But thankfully, you have been granted mercy from the depths.
[They interlace their four hands.]
We have to go forward with caution, lest we anger the seas again.
I know everyone is antsy to see the surface, but we must ascend slowly...
[The Speaker sighs.]
//LEARNED: SLOW ASCENT

//LIMITED SUPPLIES
If supplies are low, whatever we do, we must not seek replenishment from the seas.
We’d assuredly sink if we tried such a thing. No, we would be swallowed.
If it were just a few of us - then maybe we could get away with it.
But the whole crew? No possibility of it.

//DEATH ABOVE
The announcement that the homeland was firing death came with no warning.
It’s only natural to assume the capitals have perished.
The sea’s surface is turbulent, that much I can tell for sure.

//UNEXPECTED
[The Speaker sighs again, heavy in their posture.]
The Seer nearly cost us our lives.
If we knew the announcement was coming ahead of time, we would have been able to dive with more care.
The CO issued the command without seeking my advice, and as such, you are damaged along with our hull.
I understand why, of course, but we must not anger the depths again.

//NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE
Our submarine is akin to a foreign body in the waters.
Think of the depths as an immune system, ready to purge us.
The engine is too unnatural for it to tolerate. So we must move with permission from the seas.

//NUCLEAR DEVASTATION
Something as unnatural as what drives our container forward is sure to be capable of devastation.
We all knew the risks of war.
I wonder what tipped the scales.

//CLOSING DIALOG
We are all glad to see you moving again.
Be careful in your steps.
I wouldn’t want you to get hurt again.

//ENDING DIALOG (IF LAST ONE SPOKEN TO)
//SCREEN SHAKES. WATER SFX PLAYS
Ah. A thankfully uneventful ascent.
You’d best be the one to check the periscope.
You’re the one the seas took mercy on, after all. It’s a sign of reverence.

Weapons Officer - teaches NUCLEAR DEVASTATION
//DEFAULT DIALOG
[The Weapons officer looks exhausted. She is wearing a heavy burden.]
... Oh... You’re alive.
That’s surprising.
[She sighs.]
I’m sure you’ve gotten the gist by now, but the world has died.
Some on the crew may be feeling more hopeful than that, but I know what those missiles can do.
Our engine keeps us afloat, but if the CO wanted to, detonating it could destroy a city.
Imagine a hundred - a thousand being dropped on a country.
...
I can only imagine the capitals retaliated the second they knew.

//LIMITED SUPPLIES
It’s ironic we’re more likely to starve to death than die by fire.
And what could we do? Restock at shore? Hah.
The radiation will poison the soil for generations.
Our best bet is to pray.

//DEATH ABOVE
You’re asking if I have anything to grieve?
My career, I guess. I was hoping to be a CO one day.
I doubt there’s anybody left to promote me.
Part of me regrets making a career out of war, but it’s too late for that now.

//UNEXPECTED
Everyone blames the seer for not seeing it, but honestly, this was the obvious outcome, wasn’t it?
We’re at war.
It was just a matter of time.

//NUCLEAR KNOWLEDGE
Those tiny explosions the Handler mentioned - they’re more powerful than you can imagine.
More powerful than any bullet, gunpowder, or napalm.
Enough to raze the world.
If the homeland has the power, I can only imagine the capitals did too.

//SLOW ASCENT
I’m not excited to see what’s become of the surface.
I can imagine it, and it’s not pretty.

//CLOSING DIALOG
I’d wish you on your way, but where are you to go?

//ENDING DIALOG (IF LAST ONE SPOKEN TO)
//SCREEN SHAKES. WATER SFX PLAYS
Mmh. We’ve surfaced.
Go see how bad it is, will you?


Commanding Officer - doesn’t move clock forward
//DEFAULT DIALOG
...
[The CO has never been one for speaking much.]
[He looks the same as ever.]
...
[He salutes you.]


Ending
//Player looks out Periscope and sees a ruined city, covered with smoke and fire. A plume of a nuclear mushroom still has remnants in the sky.
//Scene is a skybox with JPGs of the burning city in the far distance. Player can spin about 180 degrees to view until they are ready to exit the scene.
//Upon exiting the scene, all NPCs are gathered around and facing the Player.
CO: ... 
CO: It is that bad, is it?
[The control room is eerily silent. The air is filled with grief.]
//Illustration of the characters huddled to cry and grieve.
[After a silence, you speak.]
“We have survived.”
CO: We have survived.
Supply: We have survived.
//Etc, repeated by each character until the game fades out
